I'm a Software Engineer and Tech Lead who has been working at N26 for the past 3 years. His main focus is mentoring team members, building backend microservices in cross-functional teams, design systems, and engineering processes that perform at scale. In my free time, I also enjoy volunteering for a non-profit organization where I teach children how to code.
